# CyberSafe SMB

**Affordable, practical cybersecurity audits, reports, and consulting for small businesses**

CyberSafe SMB helps small business owners protect customer data, payment systems, employee access, and online presence—without expensive managed IT providers. We deliver clear, actionable assessments tailored to non-technical owners (restaurants, salons, contractors, retail, offices, etc.).

We also offer **free or pro-bono** basic audits to residential users in our local community (Ronkonkoma area) for goodwill, referrals, and brand building.
