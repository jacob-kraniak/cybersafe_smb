CyberSafe Home - Revised Business Plan
Date: July 2, 2025

Executive Summary
CyberSafe Home has pivoted to focus on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), offering simplified, affordable cybersecurity audits inspired by enterprise-grade frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOC 2. With cyber threats costing SMBs thousands in downtime and lost trust, our service provides actionable, budget-friendly assessments and consultations. Our core offering is a tiered audit system (Basic, Premium, Pro) delivered via a streamlined online platform, with upsells for remediation consults and ongoing monitoring. The goal is to acquire 150 SMB customers and achieve $15,000 in revenue by year-end 2025, with plans to explore B2B licensing in 2026.

Business Objectives

Launch an SMB-focused minimum viable product (MVP) by August 15, 2025.
Acquire 150 SMB customers by December 31, 2025.
Achieve $15,000 in revenue by year-end 2025.
Develop a scalable B2B licensing model by Q2 2026.


Stage 1: Research and Development (July 2025)
Goal: Refine the SMB-focused audit framework and align with enterprise standards.
Actionable Items:

Update the 15-Point Checklist for SMBs:
Adapt the existing 15-point checklist (e.g., strong passwords, 2FA, backups) to include SMB-specific concerns (e.g., POS system security, employee phishing training).
Add 5 SMB-focused points (e.g., “Secure customer payment data,” “Train staff on phishing”) for a total of 20 points in the Basic Package.
Ensure alignment with NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 (e.g., map “Secure Wi-Fi” to NIST PR.AC-05, ISO A.13.1.1, SOC 2 CC6.6).


Expand Premium and Pro Packages:
Premium Package: Add 10 points (e.g., dark web exposure, cloud security) for a 30-point audit.
Pro Package: Add 20 points (e.g., zero trust, incident response) for a 50-point audit.
Draft 1-2 sentence recommendations for each point (e.g., “Enable 2FA on your POS: Go to Square Dashboard > Security.”).


Test with SMBs:
Share the Basic Package audit with 5 local SMBs (e.g., hairdressers, mechanics) for feedback on relevance and clarity.
Iterate based on responses (e.g., simplify technical terms like “2FA” to “two-step login”).


Enhance Tools:
Use free tools (e.g., Google Forms for audits, Have I Been Pwned for breach checks).
Budget $20/month for a dark web scanning API (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API) for Premium/Pro Packages.



Time: ~40 hours (2 weeks).

Stage 2: Branding and MVP Creation (July - August 2025)
Goal: Build an SMB-focused brand and a functional MVP.
Actionable Items:

Refine Branding:
Keep “CyberSafe Home” name but update tagline to “Affordable Cybersecurity for Small Businesses.”
Use Canva to redesign logo and graphics with a professional, SMB-friendly aesthetic (e.g., blue for trust, clean fonts).


Update Website MVP:
Upgrade Carrd.co site ($19/year, Pro Standard) to include:
Homepage with tagline, free audit link, and “Our Services” section (Basic: $40, Premium: $100, Pro: $250).
SMB-focused copy (e.g., “Protect your customer data without enterprise costs”).
Lead capture form linked to Google Forms for free audit.


Test form submission and results delivery with 3 SMBs.


Set Pricing:
Basic Package: $40 (15-point audit + report).
Premium Package: $100 (30-point audit + 1-hour consult).
Pro Package: $250 (50-point audit + 2-hour consult + 3 months monitoring).
Optional: $12/month monitoring (dark web scans, breach alerts).


Create Social Media Assets:
Design 3 Canva posts for X and LinkedIn (e.g., “SMBs lose $25K on average to cyber attacks—take our free audit!” with a link to https://cybersafehome.org).
Save as PNGs for sharing.



Time: ~30 hours (1.5 weeks).

Stage 3: Launch and Marketing (August - September 2025)
Goal: Launch the MVP and acquire initial SMB customers.
Actionable Items:

Launch SMB Campaign:
Post on X and LinkedIn targeting SMBs: “Hi small biz owners! A data breach could cost you thousands. Take our free 15-point audit at https://cybersafehome.org to secure your business.”
Use hashtags: #SmallBusiness #Cybersecurity #SMB.
Target 100 engagements (likes, shares, clicks).


Local Outreach:
Attend 2 Chamber of Commerce events; offer a 15-minute “Cybersecurity Checkup” talk.
Email 20 local SMBs weekly (e.g., via Google Maps) using the outreach email template.
Post in 5 local business Facebook groups: “Hi [Group Name], I’m Jacob from CyberSafe Home. Protect your customer data with our $40 audit! Start free at https://cybersafehome.org.”


Lead Magnet:
Create a 1-page PDF: “Top 10 Cybersecurity Tips for SMBs” (e.g., “Use 2FA on your POS,” “Train staff on phishing”).
Offer it on Carrd in exchange for email via Google Form.


Track Metrics:
Use Google Analytics (GA4) to monitor:
Website visits (target: 200).
Free audit completions (target: 50).
Conversion to paid packages (target: 10).


Use Bitly to track link clicks from social media and emails.



Time: ~50 hours (2 months).

Stage 4: Refinement and Growth (October - December 2025)
Goal: Improve the product and scale to 150 SMB customers.
Actionable Items:

Enhance Website:
Purchase a custom domain (e.g., cybersafehome.org, $15/year via Namecheap).
Add visuals (e.g., progress bar for audit, icons for packages).
Integrate Stripe for payments ($0 setup, ~2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).


Automate Processes:
Use Zapier ($19/month, Starter plan) to automate:
Google Form submission → Add to Google Sheet → Create Zoho Books customer → Send invoice.
Auto-email audit results with package upsell links.


Set up Google Apps Script to calculate audit scores (e.g., =SUM(B2:P2)/15*100 for Basic Package).


Expand Marketing:
Write 2 blog posts for SEO (e.g., “Why SMBs Need Cybersecurity Now,” “5 Common SMB Cyber Risks”).
Partner with a local SMB (e.g., coffee shop) for co-branded flyers (e.g., “Get a free audit with your coffee!”).


Pilot Pro Package:
Offer the Pro Package ($250) to 5 SMBs at a discount ($150) for feedback.
Include 3 months of monitoring (manual dark web scans via Have I Been Pwned).



Time: ~60 hours (3 months).

Stage 5: Scaling and Revenue Growth (January - June 2026)
Goal: Expand offerings and hit $15,000 in revenue.
Actionable Items:

Scale SMB Audits:
Market to regional Chambers of Commerce and online SMB groups (e.g., Reddit’s r/smallbusiness).
Target 50 Basic, 50 Premium, and 50 Pro Package customers.


Launch Subscription Services:
Promote $12/month monitoring to all customers post-audit.
Target 30 subscribers by June 2026 ($12 x 30 x 6 = $2,160).


Hire Support:
Hire a part-time contractor ($20/hour, 10 hours/week) to handle report generation and customer queries.
Document processes in a Google Doc (e.g., “How to Generate a CyberSafe Report”).


Explore B2B Licensing:
Pitch the audit framework to ISPs or local banks (e.g., “Offer our audit to your SMB clients for $5/user”).
Aim for 1 pilot deal by Q2 2026.



Time: ~80 hours (6 months).

Financial Projections
Startup Costs (Year 1):

Domain and hosting: $50
Tools (Canva Pro, Zapier, dark web API): $250
Marketing (ads, flyers, Chamber events): $300
Total: ~$600

Revenue Streams:

Basic Package: $40 x 50 = $2,000
Premium Package: $100 x 50 = $5,000
Pro Package: $250 x 50 = $12,500
Monitoring: $12 x 20 x 6 months = $1,440
Total (Year 1): ~$20,940 (conservative; aim for $15,000 to account for discounts/refunds)

Break-Even Point: ~15 Basic Packages or 3 Pro Packages.

Risks and Mitigation

Low SMB Awareness:
Mitigation: Use relatable marketing (e.g., “A hack could cost your shop $10K—secure it for $40!”).


Competition:
Mitigation: Differentiate with affordability and personalized consults; highlight enterprise framework alignment.


Tech Costs:
Mitigation: Start with free tools (Google Forms, Sheets); scale to paid tools (Zapier, Stripe) with revenue.
