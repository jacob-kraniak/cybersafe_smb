# Lead Intake Process

## Step 1: Lead Engagement
**Goal:** Attract potential customers (primarily small businesses) and capture their interest.

1. **Outreach to Small Businesses**
   - **Local Outreach**
     - Attend local business events (e.g., Chamber of Commerce meetings) and offer a free 15-minute “Cybersecurity Checkup” talk.
     - Post in local business Facebook groups: “Hi [Group Name], I’m Jacob from CyberSafe Home. We help small businesses like mechanics and hairdressers protect customer data affordably. Start with our free audit at https://cybersafehome.org!”
   - **Email Outreach**
     - Identify 5–10 local businesses weekly (e.g., via Google Maps).
     - Subject: “Protect [Business Name] from Cyber Threats”
     - Body: Personalized introduction + link to free audit + package overview.
   - **Lead Magnet**
     - Offer a free “Small Business Cybersecurity Checklist” PDF.
     - Collect email via Carrd → Google Form → auto-email PDF.

2. **Engagement for Individuals**
   - Post on X, Instagram, Nextdoor, Reddit with the free audit link.

3. **Tracking**
   - Use Google Analytics 4 to monitor traffic sources and form submissions.

**Time:** ~2–3 hours/week.

## Step 2: Lead Intake and Qualification
**Goal:** Capture leads, qualify them, and guide them to the right package.

1. Free audit form collects name, email, business type (if any), and 15 questions.
2. Auto-calculate score in Google Sheets and send personalized email with score and package options.
3. Categorize leads (Small Business vs. Individual, High/Medium/Low interest based on score).

**Time:** ~1–2 hours setup, ~15 min/day review.

## Step 3: Package Selection and Service Delivery
1. Personalized follow-up emails based on segment and score.
2. Separate Google Forms for Basic ($40), Premium ($100), Pro ($250).
3. Generate report from template, export PDF, email with invoice, schedule consult (30 min / 1 hr / 2 hr).
4. Activate 3-month monitoring for Pro customers.

**Time:** ~30–45 min per customer.

## Step 4: Invoicing
1. Create invoice in Zoho Books with attached report.
2. Send, track, and follow up on overdue payments.

**Time:** ~10–15 min per invoice.

## Step 5: Customer Retention
1. Post-consult thank-you + summary.
2. Manage monitoring subscriptions ($12/month).
3. Request feedback and referrals.
4. Re-engage every 3 months with discount offers.

**Time:** ~15–30 min per customer follow-up.
