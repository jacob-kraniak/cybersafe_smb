# CyberSafe SMB Post-Pivot Roadmap

## Vision
Become the go-to affordable cybersecurity partner for small businesses in Long Island (and eventually nationwide), generating sustainable recurring revenue through audits, consulting, and monitoring.

## Phase 1: Branding & Messaging Lock-In (Feb–Mar 2026)
- Update all materials to "CyberSafe SMB" primary branding
- Make residential audits explicitly free/pro-bono
- Revise website (Carrd) with SMB-focused hero, testimonials, and compliance mentions
- Secure cybersafesmb.com domain (or similar) and set up redirect

## Phase 2: Product & Process Optimization (Mar–Apr 2026)
- Reframe tiers for SMB value (increase monitoring to $15–19/mo)
- Strengthen Pro tier with "aligned with NIST/ISO/SOC 2" language + disclaimers
- Update lead qualification to prioritize SMBs (industry, employee count, pain points)
- Automate more with Zapier (form → Zoho customer → invoice)
- Test pro-bono residential flow (target 10 local audits)

## Phase 3: Revenue Acceleration (Apr–Jun 2026)
- Outreach mix: 80% SMB (Chamber events, LinkedIn, targeted emails), 20% community residential
- KPI targets:
  - 10 paying SMB customers
  - $2–3k monthly run-rate
  - First recurring monitoring subscribers
- Add Stripe/PayPal for instant payments

## Phase 4: Scalability & Retention (Q3 2026+)
- Launch quarterly/annual audit subscriptions
- Explore light managed detection & response add-on ($99–199/mo)
- Partner with local accountants, insurance agents, and POS vendors for referrals
- Build case studies and testimonials from early SMB wins

## Risks & Mitigations
- Slow SMB conversion → Double down on local networking and free value (checklists, talks)
- Scope creep → Keep offering tightly scoped; no custom tooling yet
- Competition → Differentiate on price, simplicity, and personal consults
